  <p>
      "The four llamas and two camels are camelids tend to be large and are strictly herbivorous. Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways. 
      They have a three- chambered rather than a four-chambered digestive tract; an upper lip that is split in two with each part separately mobile;
      and an isolated incisor in the upper jaw. They have long legs that, because they lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body, look longer still. (from Wikipedia)".
